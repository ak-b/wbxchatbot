Marvin currently supports 17 features((https://wiki.cisco.com/display/AS13445/Usage+Guide)) for the IaaS-FW firewall team and 1 feature for all users-TAC(https://wiki.cisco.com/display/AS13445/Usage+Guide+Generic).The bot has integrations with NetDB, FW devices(read-only),Solar winds, STAP, IaaS engine, F5 IPI database and F5 feed server. I have masked the F5 feed server features temporarily till we get the server credentials that donâ€™t need root access to make add/update/rollback changes to prevent root security vulnerability.
